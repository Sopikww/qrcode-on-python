First, you need to download the necessary libraries for Python.
You can download them yourself:qrcode, segno, tkinter.
Alternatively, you can simply run "import library.bat" and everything will be downloaded automatically.

Let's get to the program itself

we launch qrcode.py. a panel will appear in front of us with a line, we write any text or insert a link in the line and then click the button at the bottom. 
After we do this, a QR code will appear.

When we hover the phone camera over it, text or a link will appear that can be clicked on
